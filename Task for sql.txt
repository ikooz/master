TASK:
we have 'Orders' and 'Customers' tables. Write query in SQL to find the customer name who placed an order with less than 100$;

Solution:

show databases;
create database testdb;
use testdb;
create table customers (customer_id int, customer_name varchar (20), city varchar (20));
insert into customers value ('01', 'Mike', 'New York');
insert into customers value ('05', 'Zusi', 'California');
insert into customers value ('02', 'Green', 'London');
create table orders (order_num int, order_amt double, customer_id int);
insert into orders value ('001', '50.5', '05');
insert into orders value ('009', '99.65', '01');
insert into orders value ('002', '100', '02');

Answer:
select distinct customer_name from customer, orders where orders.order_amt < 100;

or

select customer.customer_name from customer join orders on customer.customer_id = orders.customer_id where orders.order_amt < 100;

or

select customer.customer_name from customer natural join orders where orders.order_amt < 100;
